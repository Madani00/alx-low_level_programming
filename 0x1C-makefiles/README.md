### Here's an example of a correct Makefile structure:

```yaml
target: dependencies
    command1
    command2
    command3
```
In this example:

- **target** is the target that needs to be built.
- **dependencies** are the files or other targets that target depends on.
- Each command (e.g., command1, command2, command3) is preceded by a **tab** character and is part of the recipe for building target.
