## Authors

## Requirements
C programming language
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
## Synopsis
This project introduces functions and nested loops in C programming. Each .c file contains a different function while the holberton.h file contains all the function prototypes.

## Description of what each file does
prints "-putchar"
prints the alphabet, in lowercase
prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
checks for lowercase character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
checks for alphabetic character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
prints the sign of a number
computes the absolute value of an integer
prints the last digit of a number
prints every minute starting from 00:00 to 23:59
prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
adds two integers and returns the result
prints all natural numbers from n to 98
prints the n times table, starting with 0
computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, this program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
